# SugarCRM-Quick-Repair-Fix

Fix file ownership and access permissions for SugarCRM or SuiteCRM: This is needed immediately after install the application when the page is missing text formatting, graphics, etc.

Another script to do an administrative "Quick Repair and Rebuild" without being logged into the application: Required after doing major changes to the application such as installing/removing a module, or upgrading the core application.  This removes all cached items so they can be regenerated for the new environment.
